Questions & Comments (Youjia Zhou):
- Why did you decide to use the sketch map for the first two panels?
  - Exploration. Alysha wanted to play around with the GMaps API.
- Visual encoding?
  - Use different sizes to represent the felt intensity/categories at the seismograph stations or use color. Use more types of visual encoding to make the visualisation more attractive and usable. 
- More interactivity for each panel?
  - Have a portion of the text that highlights a specific part of the visualisation to add additional interactivity. 
- Current progress looks promising, looking forward to seeing the final result.
- Two weeks away from being done; still need to do the video casting and the process book, so manage the time better.
