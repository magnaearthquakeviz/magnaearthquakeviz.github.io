## Feedback Notes

### LeAnn Lindsey
- Likes the idea of "scrolly-telling". How well-defined are the pages?
    - We have not delegated specific pages to group members but we think the general content is set. The similarity of some of the visualizations to class homework assignments and the possible reuse of maps on different pages should make the amount manageable.
- It seems like there are a lot of visualizations in a short amount of time. Consider prioritizing the screens that are most important. 
    - A lot of these visualizations we have already done as part of this class, so there shouldn't be too much "new" stuff to figure out.
    - Additionally, most of the visualizations work with a mpa, so we can reuse a lot of code or extract portions into classes/objects for reuse.
- How are you using color?
    - Seismology typically encodes time or depth with color. We haven't talked too much about how we are going to use color in our visualisations, but we expect it will follow the norm.
    - Additionally, by breaking up the visualisations we will be able to use color more liberally.
- Would like to know more about historic earthquakes. How often do big earthquakes occur and should she be concerned?
    - This is a good idea to include in one of our educational sections, and would likely fit in well in the intro or first "page". 
- Do we have all the data required to implement these views?
    - We have most of the data we need for most of the views. Alysha is working on getting more specific data like waveforms and specific station data.

### Kimberly Truong
- What are necessary interactive features?
    - Highlighting data with linked views between different visualizations on the same page to help relate information.
- Really like the educational aspect, but worries that interactive features may need to be pointed out to emphasize how people can engage with the data. If we want to highlight a specific data point to guid e the story, that should be the first view shown and it can be changed with the interaction.
    - This is very good feedback and something we will likely implement. 

### Lourdes Valdez
- Is the per-page interactivity optional?
    - No, the full interactive page at the end is optional. Educating the user is the main objective and is accomplished in the previous pages.
- "I think this is really cool and I like what you're doing"
    - Thanks!
    
## Summary
The feedback we received from the Visualization of Metagenomic Data group was fair and helpful. They provided good ideas on educational and view information to include to improve our design, such as emphasizing the interactive elements of each page to make sure the user is clear on how they can engage with the data. This is very helpful as we have several pages that may have different interactive elements and it could make it confusing. Overall, all their feedback was very useful and gave us more specific points to think about in designing our visualization.
