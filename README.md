## Project Overview
We hope to create an effective and informative visualisation centered around the 2020 Magna Earthquake Sequence and the resulting aftershocks. In the aftermath of this earthquake, social media and the news were filled with misinformation and confusion about aftershocks, possibilites of a larger earthquake, and other similar items. We plan to create our visualisation as a way to explain and reduce many of the worries people have during earthquakes and their aftershocks by analyzing the Magna Sequence and its many aftershocks.
