                        <ul>
                            <li>Earthquakes generally get weaker the farther away from the source you are</li>
                            <li>Intensity is used to describe local shaking and it is determined by damage and
                                experiences
                                of those who felt it.
                            </li>
                            <li>The most common scale is the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, which ranges from
                                category I to category XII. Here are some examples:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I - Not felt - Not felt except by very few under the right conditions.</li>
                                    <li>V - Moderate - Felt by most. Some dishes and windows are broken.</li>
                                    <li>VIII - Severe - Considerable damage to ordinary buildings. Fall of chimneys and
                                        factory stacks. Heavy furniture overturned.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>IX - Violent - Considerable damage to specially designed buildings. Liquefaction
                                        occurs.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>XI - Catastrophe - Few, if any, structures remain standing.</li>
                                    <li>XII - Enormous Catastrophe - Damage is total.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Look at the intensity recorded by the different seismometers (triangles) operated by the
                                University of Utah Seismograph Stations by hovering over them!

                        <h2>Aftershocks</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aftershocks are named because they are just that, shocks that come after the main
                                earthquake.
                            </li>
                            <li>Both the power and the number of the aftershocks will decrease as time goes on.</li>
                            <li>Having an earthquake does not necessarily release enough stress to prevent a larger
                                earthquake
                                later. Having an earthquake actually slightly increases the chance of a larger
                                earthquake
                                happening in the next couple of days by around 5%. Think of this like a pencil
                                splintering
                                before it cracks when you bend it too far. If this situation is the case, the first
                                quake is
                                known as a foreshock.

                        <h2>Magnitudes are a way to describe how big an earthquake is. They generally decrease with
                            time.</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Magnitude is a logarithmic scale! This means that a magnitude 2 earthquake is ten times
                                as
                                powerful as a magnitude 1 earthquake [cite], and a magnitude 3 is ten times more
                                powerful
                                than a
                                magnitude 2. So while the difference between 2 and 5.7 might not seem like that much, a
                                magnitude
                                5.7 can shake buildings miles away, while a magnitude 2 can barely be felt at the same
                                distance.
                            </li>
                            <li>Things aren't so simple though: it is possible for an earthquake to have several
                                different
                                magnitude estimates depending on the waves and frequencies used in the calculation
                                [cite].
                            </li>
                            <li>The largest earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude 9.5 [cite]! This earthquake had a
                                rupture
                                area that was around 1000 km long and 150 km wide, though. Since a fault line that big
                                doesn't exist
                                in Utah, and since earthquake magnitude is limited by the area available for rupture,
                                Utah
                                won't be seeing an earthquake on that magnitude for quite some time [cite].

                        <ul>
                            <il>Earthquake depth in Utah is usually between 5 and 25 kilometers. [find source] [cite]
                            </il>
                            <il>The depth of an earthquake can affect how the shaking feels. A deeper earthquake is less
                                intense but is felt farther away. A shallower earthquake is more intense but shakes a
                                smaller area.
                                Think of this like a flashlight: the closer a flashlight is to a table, the brighter and
                                smaller
                                the radius of the light is. As you pull the flashlight away from the table it gets
                                dimmer
                                and
                                the radius gets larger.[cite]
