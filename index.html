                                    <p>A normal fault is formed by extension, which causes the block of earth on top of the fault to 
                                        slide down relative to the block below. This is why we have mountains to the east of the 
                                        Wasatch Fault Zone and valleys to the west. Other kinds of faults are strike-slip faults 
                                        like the San-Andreas in California and thrust faults, which usually occur at subduction zones 
                                        where one tectonic plate is being pushed under another plate. <cite><a href="#references">[9]</a></cite>

                                    <p>The Wasatch Fault Zone is made up of 10 individual faults that are each ~30-60 km long and are 
                                        called fault segments. The five central fault segments are the most active faults and can produce 
                                        the largest earthquakes. These are the Brigham City, Weber, Salt Lake City, Provo, and Nephi segments.

                                    <p>A recurrence interval is an estimate of how often large earthquakes occur on a fault and is calculated using
                                        paleoseismology, or the study of historic earthquakes. By averaging the amount of time between large earthquakes 
                                        occurring on a fault segment in the past, estimates of when the next large earthquake may occur can be made. The 
                                        recurrence interval is ~900-1300 years for the 5 central Wasatch Faults. These are just estimates though and there 
                                        is no way to predict earthquakes.

                                    <p>Though the Magna earthquake was the largest earthquake occurring in the Wasatch Fault Zone recently, it is considered 
                                        a moderately sized earthquake. The 5 central segments of the Wasatch Fault Zone can produce earthquakes with magnitudes 
                                        between 7 and 7.5. In the last 6000 years paleoseismology has determined that there have been at least 22 large earthquakes 
                                        on the central segments.

                                    When a fault ruptures, it creates seismic waves that travel through the earth and result in shaking. 
                                    Loose, soft materials, like unconsolidated sediments, cause the shaking to intensify because the seismic 
                                    waves must slow down which cause them to increase in amplitude. The thicker the sediment layer, the more 
                                    intense the shaking. So, valleys tend to have more intense shaking than places located on hard rock.

                                    As seismic waves travel through the earth, they begin to lose energy. This means that at farther distances,
                                     intensity begins to decrease. The decrease will not be uniform in all directions though, because the waves 
                                     will pass through different types of materials. Also, when the fault slips it may focus its energy more strongly 
                                     in one direction than another.

                                    An earthquake produces several types of seismic waves that differ in the way they travel. 
                                    There are two main categories, body waves and surface waves. Body waves travel through the
                                    inner layers of the earth and surface waves travel along the earth’s surface. 
                                    <h3><b>Surface Waves:</b></h3>
                                    <li>
                                        These arrive last and move side-to-side or in a rolling motion like a wave. These waves are often what cause large damages.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>P or primary waves are always the first to arrive. 
                                        They are compressional, which means they travel how a slinky moves when 
                                        you push it towards someone holding the other end.

                                    <li>S or secondary waves are the second to arrive. These are shear waves, 
                                        so they travel how a slinky moves if you shake it side to side. The amplitude 
                                        for S-waves are generally larger than the amplitude for P-waves. Because S-waves
                                        rely on friction, they do not travel through liquid.

                                <p>When a large earthquake occurs, it is called a mainshock. If a larger earthquake occurs after
                                    the mainshock, then the original mainshock becomes a foreshock.
                                    Those that occur after the mainshock are called aftershocks.  The largest earthquake is always the mainshock.

                                    Aftershocks occur because the mainshock causes major stress changes in the surrounding area and it must readjust. 
                                    Aftershocks are natural and expected. As time goes on, the frequency and size of aftershocks generally decrease. This is only an average
                                    though, which means large aftershock can occur several days or weeks later.

                                    A common misconception is that large earthquakes release enough stress to prevent an even larger earthquake in the future. 
                                    An earthquake increases the chance of having a larger earthquake by a small amount (~5%) for the next few weeks. Besides, a one unit increase in magnitude
                                     corresponds to ~32x more energy, so there is no way for a magnitude 5 to release enough energy to prevent a magnitude 6.

                                            Magnitudes are used to measure how big an earthquake is. 
                                            They are often measured from the amplitude of the seisimic waves that are recorded at seismometers.
                                            The best way to measuere the size of an earthquake is with 
                                            the seismic momement, which is proportional to the size of the area that slipped multiplied by how far it slipped. 
                                            This is hard to measure, but when it is, it is used to calculate the moment magnitude. Moment magnitude is used 
                                            to relate seismic moment to other types of magnitude estimation.

                                            Magnitude is a logarithmic scale! This means that a magnitude 3 earthquake is ten times
                                            larger than a magnitude 2 earthquake, and 100x larger than magnitude 1 earthquake.

                                            The largest earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude 9.5! This earthquake moved an area 
                                            around 1000 km long and 150 km wide <cite><a href="#references">[10]</a></cite>. Since earthquake size 
                                            is limited by the area available for rupture, this large of an earthquake cannot occur in Utah. The largest possible
                                            earthquake for Utah is likey between a magnitude 7 and 7.5 <cite><a href="#references">[1] </a></cite> </p>.

                                             When an earthquake occurs it releases energy in the form of seismic waves. Energy is more directly related to the 
                                             expected damages than earthquake size. For every unit increase in magnitude, ~32x more energy is released! So, magnitude 6 may 
                                             not seem that much greater than a magnitude 5, but it would certainly feel much stronger!

                                        Depth affects how an earthquake will feel at the surface. A good analogy is a flashlight. The closer a flashlight is to 
                                        a surface, the smaller and brighter the circle of light. As you move the flashlight farther away, the circle grows
                                        but decrease in brightness. Therefore, shallow earthquakes are more intense but are more focused whereas deeper earthquakes
                                        are less intense but felt by a wider area. <cite><a href="#references">[6]</a></cite> </p>
